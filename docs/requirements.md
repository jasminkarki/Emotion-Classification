## Context on the Product

### We need to know where the product fits in in their overall scheme of things.

**Why do you need this new system? What is the business need?**
* Need: To know the emotion of students at the University. 
* Business Need: 
** Increase the performance of the students in tests and examination and 
** Increase the enrollment of students at the University

**Is there a system in place to do it right now (even if manual)? If so, how is it done right now? Is the process documented?** 
* Based on the status posted by the students in the University Chatroom, the teachers identify if the students are happy or sad with the curriculum, teachers, department, and even the management. 
* The process is not documented. 

**Even if not, How would an expert in space approach this problem? What would be the variables/pieces of data that a person would base a solution on?  (These questions help us picture and formulate a simple baseline and also gain insights into some domain intuitions that might be helpful in the future.)**


**What features do you like about your current system?**
* Easily understandable 

**What features don't you like about the current system? (Help identify pain points.)** 
* Not trustworthy
* Time-consuming
* Not all students post without hesitation 




## About the new system/product

**What are the basic, crucial needs of the new software?**
* Detecting the emotion of the students.


**What benefit can the product provide for your customers?**
* Detect students emotions so that we can formulate plans accordingly.
> (Eg. If the majority of students are unhappy, we can search for the reason behind it)

**What should be the top priority? (We should be able to distinguish the must-haves, should-haves, and could-haves.)**


* Must-haves:
> - must be able to classify emotions with 70% accuracy (for now).

* Should have
> -

* Could have
> -

**What are the acceptance criteria, if any? Please be specific. Eg: 20% decrease in manual responses to tickets. Do you have systems in place to measure those metrics? (If you can’t measure it, you can’t improve it.)**
* 70% accuracy in the validation set of client.



## System Usage

**Which of your staff will be using or involved in the product the most?**
* Teachers

**Will the system need to integrate with any other type of software? (These will influence how the system is built later on.)**
* University/College chat group.
	

## About the Data


**What data do you have that might be related, in any way, to the problem being solved? (Practically, we can never have too much data.)**



**How is the data stored, manipulated right now? What’s your data infrastructure? (How they store and process the data that they have may influence our own processes and possibilities.)**
* Most of the data is stored in a document with just an index in front of them. We also have handwritten reviews that either need to be typed or read using OCR.



**Do you have internal data-dedicated teams? (It’s helpful to know, to some extent, their data expertise.)**
* Each teacher has also asked for the review after each class and we have scraped data from their social media groups with the help of CRs but we don’t have a dedicated team for data analysis with us. 



## Caveats

**What are the constraints on the system being built (resourcing, timing, etc)? (Time constraint: As we implement the new policies from the new session(say January), it needs to completed before Jan.)**
* The system needs to be built before summer intake i.e. the system should be deployed before May 2021

**What is the strategy for your organization? [One year, five years]. Are there considerations that need to be taken into account?**
* The system will be implemented and tested for a year but the impact of the system is seen daily with the class attendance.

## General
**Do you have a timeline in mind?**
